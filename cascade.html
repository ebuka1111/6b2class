      <h2>Nazism</h2>

      <p>
        The full name of the party was Nationalsozialistische Deutsche
        Arbeiterpartei (English: National Socialist German Workers' Party) and
        they officially used the acronym NSDAP. The term "Nazi" was in use
        before the rise of the NSDAP as a colloquial and derogatory word for a
        backwards farmer or peasant, characterising an awkward and clumsy
        person, a yokel.
      </p>

      <p>
        The historical roots of Nazism are to be found in various elements of
        European political culture which were in circulation in the intellectual
        capitals of the continent, what Joachim Fest called the "scrapheap of
        ideas" prevalent at the time
      </p>

      <p>
        The Nazis claimed that Bismarck was unable to complete German national
        unification because Jews had infiltrated the German parliament and they
        claimed that their abolition of parliament had ended this obstacle to
        unification.

        Adolf Hitler and other proponents denied that Nazism was either
        left-wing or right-wing: instead, they officially portrayed Nazism as a
        syncretic movement.
